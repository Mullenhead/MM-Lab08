The four pillars of OOP:
Abstraction, the high concept of what the object does.
Encapsulation, The idea that the user doesâ€™t need to know how it all works.
Inheritance, the borrowing of functions or traits from another class
Polymorphism, the idea that an object can take on many different forms

Think of the Class as the instructions and blueprint for the object, while the object is 
an instance of the class. Objects can contain both data(properties and functionality(methods) of the class. When an object 
is created from a class it inherits the properties and functionality of that class
